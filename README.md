# CSGO-Arduino-Project
This was a summer project I started for fun. The idea was to build a device that would act similarly to the bomb in CSGO. This would then be used for Airsoft battles between my friends.
This project utilizes the following hardware:
- Arduino UNO
- SparkFun Qwiic Keypad - 12 Button
- 2 Breadboards
- Keylock Switch
- LED - Assorted
- Metal Pushbutton - Latching
- Toggle Switch and Cover - Illuminated
- Jumper Wires Standard 7" M/M
- Large Piezo Alarm - 3kHz
- Rocker Switch
- SparkFun Triple Axis Accelerometer Breakout - MMA8452Q
- Rotary Potentiometer - 10k Ohm, Linear
- SparkFun Qwiic Shield for Arduino
- Qwiic Cable
- SparkFun 16x2 SerLCD - RGB on Black 3.3V

All Programming and Wiring was handle by myself.
This project was a success and enabled me to flesh out both hardware and software engineering in a project environment.
